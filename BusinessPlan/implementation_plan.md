# Implementation Plan

1. **Project Setup**
   - Run `expo init` to create the project with TypeScript.
   - Initialize Git repository and push to GitHub.
   - Configure Supabase (database, auth, storage) and Expo environment variables.

2. **Authentication**
   - Implement sign-up/login with Supabase Auth.
   - Create Login/Registration screens.

3. **Customer Management**
   - Define customer schema in Supabase.
   - Build Customers list and detail screens with CRUD functionality.

4. **Invoicing and Estimates**
   - Design invoice/estimate templates in UI.
   - Create screens for generating, editing, and sending (via SendGrid).
   - Add logic for totals, taxes, and estimate-to-invoice conversion.

5. **Contract Signing**
   - Integrate DocuSeal API for contract workflows.
   - Build screens for uploading contracts and tracking signing status.

6. **Appointment Scheduling**
   - Add React Native Calendars for calendar UI.
   - Create appointment creation/editing screens with Expo Notifications for reminders.

7. **Document Scanning**
   - Implement Expo Camera for scanning documents.
   - Upload scans to Supabase Storage.
   - For premium users, integrate Google Cloud Vision API for OCR.

8. **Data Dashboards**
   - Query aggregated data from Supabase (e.g., sales, appointments).
   - Use Victory Native to render charts.
   - Build customizable dashboard screen.

9. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Write unit tests for components and services.
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (lint, test, build).
   - Deploy web version via Expo hosting; submit iOS/Android builds to app stores.

**Notes:** Break each step into smaller tasks (e.g., design, code, test) and assign deadlines/milestones as needed.
